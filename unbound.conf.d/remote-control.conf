remote-control:
    # control-enable: <yes or no>
    #     The  option is used to enable remote control, default is "no".  If
    #     turned off, the server does not listen for control commands.
    control-enable: yes

    # control-interface: <ip address or path>
    #     Give IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or local socket path to listen on  for
    #     control  commands.   By  default  localhost (127.0.0.1 and ::1) is
    #     listened to.  Use 0.0.0.0 and ::0 to listen to all interfaces.  If
    #     you  change  this  and  permissions  have  been  dropped, you must
    #     restart the server for the change to take effect.

    #     If you set it to an absolute path, a local socket  is  used.   The
    #     local  socket  does  not  use  the certificates and keys, so those
    #     files need not be present.  To restrict access, unbound sets  per-
    #     missions on the file to the user and group that is configured, the
    #     access bits are set to allow the group members to access the  con-
    #     trol socket file.  Put users that need to access the socket in the
    #     that group.  To restrict access further, create a directory to put
    #     the control socket in and restrict access to that directory.
    control-interface: 0.0.0.0
    control-interface: ::1

    # control-port: <port number>
    #     The  port number to listen on for IPv4 or IPv6 control interfaces,
    #     default is 8953.  If you change this  and  permissions  have  been
    #     dropped,  you  must  restart the server for the change to take ef-
    #     fect.
    control-port: 8953

    # control-use-cert: <yes or no>
    #     For localhost control-interface you can disable the use of TLS  by
    #     setting this option to "no", default is "yes".  For local sockets,
    #     TLS is disabled and the value of this option is ignored.
    control-use-cert: yes

    # server-key-file: <private key file>
    #     Path to the server private  key,  by  default  unbound_server.key.
    #     This file is generated by the unbound-control-setup utility.  This
    #     file is used by the unbound server, but not by unbound-control.
    server-key-file: /etc/unbound/unbound_server.key

    # server-cert-file: <certificate file.pem>
    #     Path to  the  server  self  signed  certificate,  by  default  un-
    #     bound_server.pem.   This  file  is  generated  by the unbound-con-
    #     trol-setup utility.  This file is used by the unbound server,  and
    #     also by unbound-control.
    server-cert-file: /etc/unbound/unbound_server.pem

    # control-key-file: <private key file>
    #     Path  to  the  control client private key, by default unbound_con-
    #     trol.key.  This file is  generated  by  the  unbound-control-setup
    #     utility.  This file is used by unbound-control.
    control-key-file: /etc/unbound/unbound_control.key

    # control-cert-file: <certificate file.pem>
    #     Path  to  the  control client certificate, by default unbound_con-
    #     trol.pem.  This certificate has to be signed with the server  cer-
    #     tificate.   This  file  is  generated by the unbound-control-setup
    #     utility.  This file is used by unbound-control.
    control-cert-file: /etc/unbound/unbound_control.pem

server:
    # statistics-interval: <seconds>
    #     The number of seconds between printing statistics to the log for
    #     every thread.  Disable with value 0 or "". Default is  disabled.
    #     The  histogram  statistics are only printed if replies were sent
    #     during  the  statistics  interval,  requestlist  statistics  are
    #     printed  for every interval (but can be 0).  This is because the
    #     median calculation requires data to be present.
    statistics-interval: 600

    # extended-statistics: <yes or no>
    #     If enabled, extended statistics are  printed  from  unbound-con-
    #     trol(8).   Default is off, because keeping track of more statis-
    #     tics takes time.  The counters are listed in unbound-control(8).
    extended-statistics: yes

    # statistics-cumulative: <yes or no>
    #     If enabled, statistics are cumulative  since  starting  unbound,
    #     without  clearing the statistics counters after logging the sta-
    #     tistics. Default is no.
    statistics-cumulative: yes
